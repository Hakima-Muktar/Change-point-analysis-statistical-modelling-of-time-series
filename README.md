### Brent Oil Price Change Point Analysis
### Overview
This project analyzes how major political and economic events affect Brent oil prices using Bayesian change point detection methods. The analysis focuses on identifying key events that have significantly impacted Brent oil prices over the past decade and quantifying their effects using statistical modeling.

### Business Context
Client: Birhan Energies - Leading consultancy firm specializing in data-driven insights for the energy sector

Objective: Provide actionable intelligence to help investors, policymakers, and energy companies navigate the complexities of the global energy market.

Tasks
#### Task 1: Laying the Foundation for Analysis
Define data analysis workflow
Research and compile event data (10-15 key events)
Document assumptions and limitations
Analyze time series properties (trend, stationarity, volatility)
Explain change point models and expected outputs
Deliverables:

##### 1-2 page document outlining analysis steps
Structured CSV with dates and event descriptions
Documentation of assumptions and limitations
Task 2: Change Point Modeling and Insight Generation
Data preparation and exploratory data analysis
Build Bayesian change point model using PyMC
Interpret model outputs and identify change points
Associate detected changes with geopolitical events
Quantify impacts of major events on price shifts
Deliverables:

Jupyter notebook with complete analysis code
Visualizations of posterior distributions and change points
Written interpretation of results with quantified impacts
Task 3: Developing Interactive Dashboard
Flask backend with REST APIs for data serving
React frontend with interactive visualizations
Event correlation and drill-down capabilities
Responsive design for multiple devices
Deliverables:

Working Flask backend with documented API endpoints
React frontend with interactive visualizations
Screenshots demonstrating dashboard functionality
Setup instructions
Technology Stack
Analysis: Python, PyMC, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
Backend: Flask, Flask-CORS
Frontend: React, Recharts/D3.js
Statistical Methods: Bayesian inference, MCMC sampling
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Node.js 14+
npm or yarn
#### Task 3: Developing Interactive Dashboard
 Interactive Price Charts: Dynamic Recharts implementation with date-range filters (1Y, 5Y, All).
 Regime Shift Overlays: Change point markers automatically overlaid on historical price data.
 Event Correlation: Visual links between price shocks and documented geopolitical events.
 Responsive UI: Optimized for all screen sizes using Tailwind CSS grid and flexbox.
##### Dashboard Features & Views:
Analytics View (Main):
Trend Chart: Visualizes the last 10+ years of Brent oil prices.
Date Range Controls: Toggle between 1-year, 5-year, and full dataset views.
Change Point Markers: Red dashed line indicating the model's most probable regime shift date.
Event Timeline (Sidebar):
Categorized Events: Scrollable list of 15 major events (Conflict, Sanctions, OPEC).
Date Sync: Each event displays the precise date, category, and historical context.
KPI Cards:
Volatility Shift: Quantified % change in market volatility after the detected change point.
Mean Change: Shift in average price returns observed after the event.
Responsiveness Behavior:
Desktop: 12-column grid with a 3:1 ratio between the chart and the event sidebar.
Tablet/Mobile: Single-column vertical layout where the sidebar drops below the chart for optimal readability on touch devices.
Dynamic Sizing: Charts utilize ResponsiveContainer to adapt height and width fluidly.

#### API Documentation
Endpoint	Method	Description
/api/prices	GET	Returns historical Brent oil prices (Date, Price)
/api/events	GET	Returns curated geopolitical events with categories and descriptions

#### Analysis Insights
Our Bayesian analysis identified a significant structural change point in early 2019, closely associated with the US ending Iran Sanctions Waivers. Post-event analysis revealed:

Volatility Increase: Approximately 127% increase in market volatility following the shift.
Regime Transition: The market moved from a period of relative stability to one characterized by frequent high-magnitude shocks.
Model Efficacy: The Bayesian model successfully "priced in" the shock approximately 20 days before the official waiver expiration.
