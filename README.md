### Brent Oil Price Change Point Analysis
### Overview
This project analyzes how major political and economic events affect Brent oil prices using Bayesian change point detection methods. The analysis focuses on identifying key events that have significantly impacted Brent oil prices over the past decade and quantifying their effects using statistical modeling.

### Business Context
Client: Birhan Energies - Leading consultancy firm specializing in data-driven insights for the energy sector

Objective: Provide actionable intelligence to help investors, policymakers, and energy companies navigate the complexities of the global energy market.
